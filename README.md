# Welcome to Dicey McDiceface
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dicey`

Two options will be available (always run [1] them in order to have website run):
[1] initialize project
[2] start packager

## About the Game
A six-sided die is rolled once every turn. The game will visually track how many of each number have been rolled, like how many 1s, 2s, etc. Once one specific number has been rolled 5 times, then that number is the winner, and the game is over. The user can then start the game over, and they can also reset the game at any point.
